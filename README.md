# Automatic XTAL parameter measurement with Rigol DSA815-TG
This is a tool that automates the process of measuring quarz crystal oscillator parameters using a Rigol DSA815-TG spectrum analyzer with the tracking generator option. You will also need a measuring fixture as described by Jack K8ZOA in "Crystal Motional Parameters: A Comparison of Measurement Approaches"

This tool uses what is known as the "-3dB method" to measure the crystal motional parameters. It lets you easily measure parameters of large batches of XTALs and produces a nice Excel spreadsheet.
